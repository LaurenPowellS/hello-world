# hello-world

Hi Earthlings!

I'm Lauren and I'm just starting out with coding.  I mostly know html and css but I'm branching out to learn more so I can become a web developer.  Right now I work at a photo lab, and I love to make things with my hands and eat strange new foods.  I started FreeCodeCamp last year but finally got the nerve to finish the portfolio project this year and hope to finish the other projetcs so I can be a full stack web developer.
